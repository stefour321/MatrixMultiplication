# MatrixMultiplication
This is a C++ application that can read in two matrices (A & B) from a text file using a command 
line argument to specify the file path and name.
This application works correctly when compiled in both OpenMP mode and non-OpenMP 
mode. It outputs the multiplied matrix to MatrixOut.txt.
